# Generative-Design-for-Max
Attempt at a Processing to Max translation of the <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/">Generative Design Book</a>

Started as a "Toolmaker in Residence" at <a href="http://signalculture.org">Signal Culture</a>, August 2016.

Some examples are in vanilla Max, most use mgraphics. Maybe someday, gen.

Very much a work in progress.
